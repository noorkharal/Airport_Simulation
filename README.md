# Airport_Simulation
Our objective was to create an air traffic control system simulation, where there is control over
the ground network objects and airplanes in order to either send or receive a plane.


## Requirements:
- Eclipse IDE
- Execution environment JRE: JavaSE-1.7


## List of Functionalities:
- Clock (stop, start, restart)
- Plane Arrival
- Plane Departure
- See real time updates of ground network and airplane list
- See bookings of ground network and airplane list
- Add airplanes
- See flight schedule
- Change details of plane arrival/departure schedule

## Details:
Details of functionality, with screenshots in report

## Limitations:
The simulation, like a real airport, has the physical constraint of the number of runways,
taxiways, and gates. We are hardcoding the limit, and are not allowing the user to have
unlimited links.
While we have not limited the number of departures and arrivals that the user can add, our
simulation cannot accommodate more than 8 queued at a time. Although we have the solution for
this, we were unable to implement it in the given time constraints. (will be implemented in next version)
